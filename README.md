# Music Genre Classification - End-to-End NLP Project

## Overview

This project aims to classify music tracks into different genres using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The end-to-end pipeline involves data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Project Structure

1. `.github/workflows/.gitkeep`
   - Importance: This file is used to ensure that the `.github/workflows` directory is tracked by Git, even if it is empty. The `.github/workflows` directory is where GitHub Actions workflows are defined. These workflows can automate tasks such as testing, building, and deploying your code.

2. `src/music_genre_classifier/logger.py`
   - Importance: Contains logging utility functions and configurations. Proper logging is crucial for monitoring the execution of your ML code and debugging issues by tracking events and errors.

3. `src/music_genre_classifier/exception.py`
   - Importance: Defines custom exceptions for handling errors in a more controlled manner. This helps in managing errors specific to your ML project and ensures that they are reported and handled appropriately.

4. `src/music_genre_classifier/__init__.py`
   - Importance: Marks the `src/music_genre_classifier` directory as a Python package, allowing you to import modules from this directory. This is essential for organizing and accessing the project's core code.

5. `src/music_genre_classifier/components/__init__.py`
   - Importance: Marks the `components` subdirectory as a Python package. The `components` folder usually contains different modules related to the core functionality of the ML project, such as data processing, feature engineering, or model components.

6. `src/music_genre_classifier/utils/__init__.py`
   - Importance: Indicates that the `utils` directory is a package. This directory typically contains utility functions or helper modules that support the main functionality of the project, such as data manipulation or custom functions.

7. `src/music_genre_classifier/config/__init__.py`
   - Importance: Marks the `config` directory as a package. It often contains configuration settings or management scripts for different aspects of the ML project, like hyperparameters or environment settings.

8. `src/music_genre_classifier/pipeline/__init__.py`
   - Importance: Signifies that the `pipeline` directory is a package. The `pipeline` folder usually includes scripts related to the ML workflow, such as data ingestion, preprocessing, training, and evaluation.

9. `src/music_genre_classifier/entity/__init__.py`
   - Importance: Indicates that the `entity` directory is a package. This directory might define data structures or classes that represent the core components of your data model.

10. `src/music_genre_classifier/constants/__init__.py`
    - Importance: Marks the `constants` directory as a package. This folder typically contains constant values or settings used throughout the project, such as file paths or default parameters.

11. `src/music_genre_classifier/utils/common.py`
    - Importance: Contains common utility functions that are used across various parts of the project. These functions could handle repetitive tasks or provide commonly used functionalities.

12. `tests/__init__.py`
    - Importance: Marks the `tests` directory as a package. This directory is used for writing and organizing test cases to ensure the correctness and reliability of your code.

13. `tests/unit/__init__.py`
    - Importance: Indicates that the `unit` directory is a package. This folder contains unit tests, which are used to test individual components or functions in isolation to verify their correctness.

15. `configs/config.yaml`
    - Importance: A YAML configuration file used to store project settings and parameters. This file allows you to manage and modify configuration settings, such as model hyperparameters or paths, in a structured format.

16. `dvc.yaml`
    - Importance: Used by Data Version Control (DVC) to manage and version datasets and machine learning models. This file helps in tracking changes to data and models, facilitating reproducibility and collaboration.

17. `params.yaml`
    - Importance: Stores model parameters and configurations. It helps in managing different hyperparameter settings and tracking their impact on model performance during experimentation.

18. `init_setup.sh`
    - Importance: A shell script used for setting up the project environment. This script might install dependencies, set environment variables, or perform other setup tasks necessary for running the project.

19. `requirements.txt`
    - Importance: Lists the Python packages required for the project. This file is used by `pip` to install all necessary dependencies for running the project.

20. `setup.py`
    - Importance: A script for packaging the project and defining its metadata, such as name, version, and dependencies. It allows the project to be installed as a Python package.

21. `research/experiment.ipynb`
    - Importance: A Jupyter Notebook used for research and experimentation. It often contains exploratory data analysis, model experimentation, and visualization of results.

22. `main.py`
    - Importance: A sample script demonstrating how to use the project's functionality. It serves as a reference or main for users on how to interact with and utilize the project's features.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains music tracks labeled with genres.

## Preprocessing

- **Text Cleaning**: Removing noise, stopwords, and performing tokenization.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting relevant features from the text and audio data.
- **Data Augmentation**: Techniques applied to balance the dataset and improve model generalization.

## Model

We experimented with several machine learning:
- **Baseline Model**: Naive Bayes

The final model was chosen based on performance metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## Evaluation

The model's performance was evaluated using standard metrics:
- **F1-Score**: Balances precision and recall.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Provides insights into classification errors.

## Deployment

The final model is deployed using a Flask app, allowing users to input lyrics and receive genre predictions in real-time.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/music-genre-classification.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd music-genre-classification
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


## Future Work

- **Model Improvements**: Exploring transformer models and fine-tuning BERT.
- **Data Expansion**: Adding more diverse datasets to improve model generalization.
- **Deployment**: Enhancing the web app with additional features like batch predictions and user feedback.
